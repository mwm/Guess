# This is a simple guessing game.

It was developed to show that an [MFlow](http://mflowdemo.herokuapp.com) web application
is no more complicated than a console application - assuming that structure is appropriate.

You may want to read the
[tutorial](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/mwm/mflow-like-a-console)
that goes with this code, or see if there is any discussion of it in the
[blog entry](http://blog.mired.org/2014/05/web-apps-that-write-like-console-apps_12.html).

The rules are simple. You are told how many matches are left, and you can take one or two
matches as a move. Whoever takes the last match wins.

To run it, select either the `Console` or `Web` target and click the triangular `Play` icon.
Unfortunately, the version of MFlow in FP Haskell Center appears to be out of date, so the
web version doesn't run properly, even though it works fine in recent versions. The console
version does work as expected.
